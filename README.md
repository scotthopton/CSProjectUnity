# CSProjectUnity

A visual training game for children ages 4 and up who live with Cortical Vision Impairment (CVI). The purpose of this game is to help these children to improve functional vision, and help them develop proper cognitive skills and hand-eye coordination. This game targets the three different phases of CVI development in young children, and each phase has unique instructional goals and environmental supports needed.
